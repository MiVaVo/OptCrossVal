OptCrossVal: cross-validation tools for porftolio optimization
=======================================
The purpose of this project is to create validation tools for portfolio optimization.
Though this repository contains some modules for portfolio optimization, the main part of portfolio optimization is taken from libraries [pyportfolioopt](https://pyportfolioopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for portfolio optimization and some other libraries.

### Prerequisits
```python
python > 3.6
pip install requirements.txt

```

#### TODO
- [x] Test cross-validation of portfolio optimization
- [ ] Write quik start
- [ ] Make better visualization with piecharts
